# What speakers need from conference organisers

This list is intended for speakers to give to organisers or for organisers to use as a guide. 
This is an early draft, GitHub allows for collaboration and contruibution so please feel free to submit edits or additions into the document.

### What format can the slides be in?

- Will slide size or dimensions be restricted by the projectors? (please give plenty of notice before speakers make their slides)
