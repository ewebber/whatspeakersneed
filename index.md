# What speakers need from conference organisers

Collected from experienced speakers to help conference organisers make things easier for speakers (many who don't get paid for their contribution to conferences) which makes the conferences run more smoothly. This list is intended for speakers to give to organisers or for organisers to use as a guide. 
This is an early draft, GitHub allows for collaboration and contruibution so please feel free to submit edits or additions into the document.

## Before applying

### What is the offer?

- Do you cover expenses and how much?
- Will you book travel and hotels?
- Do you pay speakers?
- Will there be a speakers dinner or socialising events? (speakers often come to events to network, so this is a good idea)

- What else are you offering speakers?

## Preparing for the talks

### What information can you tell speakers about the conference USP?

- What is unique about this conference? What's vision? What sets it apart from other existing conferences? 

### What information can you tell people about the audience?

- What sectors do they work in?
- What is their experience in the topics that the speaker is covering?

### Can speakers use their own laptop?

*Many speakers prefer to use their own kit because it is set up in the way they like and many edit slides up to the last moment*

- What projector connectors will the conference provide? (HDMI, VGA)
- What power cables will the conference provide?
- Will a remote slide changer be provided?
- Should video be embedded in the presentation or provided as a separate file?

### Will speakers need to use a microphone?

*this might affect what people can wear*

If so:
- is it handheld? They may need some guidance on how to hold it
- is it a lapel mic and battery pack? They will need a belt or a pocket for the pack
- something else?

### Are you filming the talks

If so:
- have you sent (and have they signed) a release form?
- does it have details of what will be done with the footage?
- can speakers walk around the stage, will the camera follow the speaker, or is it fixed at the podium?

### What format can the slides be in?

- Will slide size or dimensions be restricted by the projectors? (please give plenty of notice before speakers make their slides) 
- Will there be an additional screen that only speakers can see and what will they see on it? (some speakers want to see the next slide and their notes)

### Is there the option to have sound?

- Will audio out be supported via 3mm headphone socket or HDMI or either?

### Will speakers be introduced or introduce themselves?

- Do you need any information in order to introduce them
- Will someone be in the room, or should they just start

### Is there any other equipment provided? (e.g. flipcharts, post-it notes, pens)

### How is the room set up?

- How will the chairs be laid out?
- How big is the room / How big might the audience be?
- What time are the speakers on? (a post lunch talk might need a bit of extra interaction)

### How will timekeeping be done?

 - Will there be a timer on the stage?
 - Will there be someone holding up signs with 10, 5, 3, 2, 1 minutes to go?
 - Will there be lights indicating time to get off the stage?
